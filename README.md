## 1️⃣ Student Information Lookup

### ✅ Description
This code takes a student’s name as input and prints their corresponding score if the name exists in the predefined dictionary. Otherwise, it prints "Student not found."

### 💡 How It Works
- A dictionary `student_info` is defined with student names as keys and their scores as values.
- The user is prompted to input a name.
- The code checks if the input exists in the dictionary:
  - If yes, it prints the corresponding score.
  - If not, it prints a message saying the student was not found.

## 2️⃣ List Slicing and Reversal

### ✅ Description
This code demonstrates how to extract the first five elements from a list and then reverse them using slicing.

### 💡 How It Works
- `original_list` is a list of integers from 1 to 10.
- `extracted_list` slices the first five elements using `original_list[:5]`.
- `reversed_list` reverses the `extracted_list` using slicing syntax `[::-1]`.
